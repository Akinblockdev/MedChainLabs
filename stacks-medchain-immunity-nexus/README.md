# MedChain Immunity Passport Protocol

> **DecentralizedHealth Verification Engine** - A privacy-preserving vaccine verification system built on Stacks blockchain

## 🌍 Project Overview

The MedChain Immunity Passport Protocol revolutionizes health verification by creating tamper-proof immunity passports while protecting sensitive medical data through zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure. Our system enables seamless international travel, employment verification, and public health compliance without compromising patient privacy.

## 🎯 Core Mission

**"Verify immunity status without revealing medical history"**

Transform health verification from a privacy nightmare into a seamless, secure, and user-controlled experience that benefits individuals, institutions, and global public health simultaneously.
